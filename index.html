            <h2>About Food Waste Management</h2>
            <p>Food waste management in India is becoming a critical problem due to the continuous increase of the Indian population. 
                Indians waste the maximum amount of food as much as the whole of the UK consumes – a data point which will not be most indicative of our love of surfeit,
                 because it is of our population. Most of the food is wasted in weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, and households. Still, food wastage is a horrendous issue, 
                 so is food waste management in India. Our streets, garbage bins, and landfills are spoiling our environment and have sufficient evidence to prove it.</p>

            <p><h4>How much food is wasted in India?</h4>

             In India, the larger the marriage, the larger the party, 
                and also the additional stupendous the waste. No doubt weddings and banquets are an enormous
                 supply of food wastage, however, restaurants and hotels conjointly contribute to food wastage,
                  although the attention around this has grown full-grown within the last 5 years. Whereas some restaurants 
                  in India use food controllers to envision food spoilage, alternatives give it to their employees and other personnel,
                   and smaller standalone restaurants, give it to orphanages.
                 Few utilize non-perishable food.
                 <h3>Food waste findings:</h3>

                 On Average, 40% of food produced were being disposed of. This means that 7.5 tons of food are discarded daily.
                  Some 84.7% of the whole waste material recorded was thrown within the bin, whereas the remainder was either fed to the poor or some animals.
                 A big portion of the waste material binned was still in edible condition.
                 If the edible waste material generated is used, we tend to estimate that it might feed a minimum of 2000 individuals daily.
                 Solely a pair of the ten shops surveyed were part waste aware, i.e., they separated the edible from the inedible, and ensured that food in condition reached empty stomachs.
                  One among them disposed of their food at twelve noon, in order that it might be fed to the cows within the space. The other claimed to administer away all edible waste material to the native laborers and employees, for free, at the tip of the day.
